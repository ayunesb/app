    <h3 id="personal-info">1. Personal Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Notice covers our use of Personal Information. <span class="highlight">"Personal
      Information,"</span> means any information that relates to you and can -- either on its own
      or in combination with other information -- identify you as an individual. Personal
      information does not include information that has been de-identified or aggregated such that
      you can no longer be identified.</p>

    <p>The types of information we collect depends on your level of engagement with the Services.
      The more you interact with the Services, the more information we need to provide the Services.
      This Section explains how we collect and use personal information based on your level of
      engagement with the Services.</p>

    <h4>A. All Users of the Hunt Sites</h4>
    <p>From registered and unregistered users of the Sites, we automatically receive and record
      information whenever you interact with the Sites. This includes IP address data from our
      server logs, cookie information, browser information, information about your activity while
      on the Sites (such as the pages you request, properties that you view or save, and property
      that you claim), and the URL of the site you came to the Sites from. We also may collect the
      mobile device ID (such as the ID for Advertising on iOS and Android ID on Android) from users
      of the Hunt Applications. If permitted by the settings on your device and/or with your
      consent, we will also collect your geo-location information. We use this to provide you with
      location specific information, such as homes for sale near your current location as determined
      by your geolocation, and information about listing your home for sale based on your
      geolocation. We may also approximate your location based off your IP address, to customize
      your experience on our Sites.</p>

    <p>We may also use the information listed above to help diagnose problems and performance with
      the Services, analyze trends, customize your experience, and administer the Services. We may
      provide IP addresses to third-parties to help us analyze website user survey data. We may
      also use the information described in this section to better target information about Hunt's
      Sites and Services, for example, by displaying more accurate or relevant information on our
      Sites, matching you to a public record listing of a property.</p>

    <h4>B. Registered Users of the Hunt Sites</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Hunt:</span> Hunt is a feature that allows you to upload notes
        and photos about a property, save searches, add favorites and x-outs, and otherwise
        organize homes that may interest you. We save all of this "My Hunt" information for use
        later in connection with our Services. It is stored with your Hunt account information.
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Account Password Security:</span> Your Hunt account password is
        encrypted on our server. It is your responsibility not to disclose your password to other

    <h4>D. Hunt Clients</h4>
    <p>When you are getting ready to buy or sell a home and you start working with our coordinators

    need to provide a lot of information as is customary for a home purchase or sale transaction.
    This information can include, without limitation, your name, address, phone number, email
    address. You, as a seller, may be legally required to disclose certain information about your

      and this Privacy Notice.</p>

      for sale. Hunt may send you Hunt-related news and surveys in accordance with applicable law.
    </p>

    <p>We may record any telephone calls between you and our agents or other representatives for
      training and quality assurance purposes.</p>

    <h4>J. Sharing with Friends or Colleagues</h4>
    <p>Hunt's Services may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or
      colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services. Email addresses that
      you may provide for a friend or colleague will be used to send your friend or colleague the
      content or link you request in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h4>K. Interactive Features</h4>
    <p>Hunt may offer interactive features such as chat services, forums, and social media pages.
      We may collect the information you submit or make available through these features. Any
      content you provide on the public sections of these channels will be considered "public"
      and will not be subject to the privacy protections referenced herein.</p>

    <h4>L. De-Identified and Aggregated Information</h4>
    <p>We may use Personal Information and other information about you to create de-identified
      and/or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified
      location information, de-identified or aggregated trends, reports, or statistics,
      information about the computer or device from which you access our Services, or other
      analyses we create. De-identified and aggregated information is used for a variety of
      functions, including the measurement of visitors' interest in and use of various portions
      or features of the Sites and Services. De-identified and aggregated information is not
      Personal Information, and we may use and disclose such information in a number of ways,
      including research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purpose.
    </p>

    <h4>M. Conferences and Trade Shows</h4>
    <p>We may attend or participate in conferences and trade shows where we collect Personal
      Information from individuals who interact with or express an interest in Hunt and/or the
      Services. If you provide us with any information at one of these events, we will use it for
      the purposes for which it was collected.</p>

    <h4>N. Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
    <p>We may collect certain information automatically when you use the Services. This
      information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, IMEI, MAC

      Information we collect may be associated with accounts and other devices.</p>

    <h4>O. Cookies and Pixel Tags/Web Beacons</h4>
    <p>We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality
    on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies
    ("Technologies") to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are
    essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices
    that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our
    Sites and Services.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Cookies. Cookies are small text files placed in visitors' device browsers to store their
      preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that,
      the Services may not work properly.</li>
    <li>Pixel Tags/Web Beacons. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code
      embedded on the Sites that collects information about users' engagement on that web page.
      The use of a pixel allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular
      web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may stop or restrict the placement of Technologies on your device or remove them by
      adjusting your preferences as your browser or device permits.</p>

      <h4>P. Information from Other Sources</h4>
    <p>We may obtain information about you from other sources, including through third-party
      services and organizations to supplement information provided by you. This supplemental
      information allows us to verify information that you have provided to us and to enhance our
      ability to provide you with the Services.</p>

      <h4>Q. Other Uses of Information</h4>
    <p>In addition to the specific collection and uses listed above, we may use any of the
      Personal Information we collect for the following business purposes:</p>
      to operate our Sites and provide our Services in accordance with our Terms of Use and/or any other agreement you may have with us;

      <li>to conduct promotional activities, including contests or surveys;</li>
      <li>to improve, upgrade or enhance our Sites and Services;</li>

      <li>to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>
      <li>to undertake activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a Service, Site or transaction;</li>
      <li>to carry out other purposes that are disclosed to you and/or to which you consent; and</li>
      <li>to pursue our legitimate interests where your rights and freedoms do not outweigh these interests.</li>
    </ul>

      valuable consideration, we may share your Personal Information with the following categories

      and advertising, or for other business or commercial purposes listed above in this Privacy
      Notice.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that home sales and purchases may be a matter of public record, and your
      name and address, the price you paid, your property taxes, and other information may be
      available from public sites regardless of the brokerage(s), if any, who assist in the
      transaction. We post on our Sites some information that typically becomes part of the public
      record of a home sale or purchase.</p>

    <h4>B. Non-Public Record Information</h4>
    <p>We share information obtained from you or third-party sources that is not on the public
      record to facilitate your home purchase or sale transaction. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlight">Service Providers to all Hunt Clients:</span> Our agents work
        with third parties to process your home search and sale transaction and must share your

        document preparation and electronic signing.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Partner Agents:</span> A Partner Agent is employed by or works
        with another brokerage and is not a representative or employee of Hunt. Partner Agents have
        contracted with us to provide Hunt-quality service to a wider range of customers. We'll
        refer you to a Partner Agent at our discretion. If you are referred to a Partner Agent for
        your home purchase or sale transaction, we share your information with that Partner Agent
        so they can assist you. Hunt is not responsible for the work performed or the services
        provided by Partner Agents in any manner.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Home Seller Service Providers:</span> We may also share your
        listing and contact information with listing vendors such as photographers, home staging
        experts and home repair professionals like plumbers and electricians, as needed.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Home Buyer Service Providers:</span> As is customary as your
        home purchase agent, we must share your buying information with inspectors, title
        companies, escrow agents, closing attorneys, lenders, and other third parties as needed
        to process your transaction.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">Potential Buyers:</span> By law, we are required to disclose
        certain information about your property to potential buyers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>C. Negotiations</h4>
    <p>We also post price offers and counteroffers on our Sites. We do not post your name on our
      Sites without your permission, but if the sale is closed, the price and the fact that you
      bought or sold your house at that price may be a matter of public record.</p>

    <h4>D. Hunt Corporate Family</h4>
    <p>We may share your information with members of the Hunt family of entities for various
      purposes, including to: (i) provide the Services to you; (ii) help detect and prevent
      potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements;

    <h4>E. Hunt Requests</h4>
    <p>Through the Services, you can make a request to tour a home, get in contact with a real
      estate agent, receive help selling or buying a home, or submit other requests. When you
      make such a request through Hunt, you authorize Hunt to share your Personal Information
      including your contact information, home search history, favorites and saved searches, with
      a real estate professional (a Hunt Agent or staff member, or a Partner Agent) for the purpose
      of responding to your request.</p>

      service you have requested. We may also provide Personal Information to business partners
      with whom we jointly offer products or services in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h4>H. Third-Party Cookies and Information Used to Target Ads to You</h4>
    <p>We may share the information that we collect about you with others (including advertising
      networks and service providers) to tailor and serve you ads on our Services, as well as other
      websites and social media networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based
      advertising" or "online behavioral advertising." These advertising networks track your online
      activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the
      use of Technologies (e.g., cookies, web-beacons and other methods). This allows Hunt to
      target our advertising to you through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. As a
      result, you may see ads for Hunt on other websites and social media.</p>

    <h4>I. APIs and SDKs</h4>
    <p>We may use third party APIs and software development kits ("SDKs") as part of the

      is more relevant to you. For more information about our use of APIs and SDKs, please contact
      us as set forth below.</p>

    <h4>J. Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</h4>
    <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization,
      bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another
      provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as
      permitted by law and/or contract.</p>

    <h4>K. Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</h4>
    <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and
      comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law
      enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
      appropriate: (i) to respond to claims or legal processes (including subpoenas); (ii) to
      protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party
      or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical
      or legally actionable.</p>

      you at the time you provide Personal Information or with your consent.</p>

      of its receipt; however, if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and
      extension period.</p>
    <p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verified
      consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
      comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
      to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit
      the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
    <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it
      is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants
      a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
      completing your request.</p>

      rates, or quality levels. Any financial incentive we offer, will reasonably relate to your
      Personal Information's value to us and contain written terms that describe the program's
      material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in
      consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>

        we change the fees for all or part of any of the Services, including by adding fees or

        changes, we may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Services to you. Our
        authorized third-party payment processors will charge the payment method you specified at
        the time of purchase or as agreed to as part of the selected Service. You authorize us to
        charge all fees as described in these Terms of Use for the Services you select to that
        payment method. If you pay any fees with a credit card, we may seek pre-authorization of

        and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums
        on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The subscription will continue
        unless and until you cancel your subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your
        Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic
        subscription fee to your account. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the
        payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method
        if you change your payment information). We may change the subscription fee for any
        subsequent subscription period but will provide you advance notice of any increase before
        it applies. Unless otherwise stated in your Product’s Terms, you may cancel a Subscription
        Service by contacting your business consultant.</li>

        use and privacy policies or other agreements, which you are solely responsible for complying
        with. We do not endorse, and take no responsibility for such products, services, Web sites,
        and materials, or a Third-Party Provider’s use of your User Information. By using a tool
        that allows for User Information to be transferred, you agree that we may transfer the
        applicable User Information or other information to the applicable third-parties, which
        are not under our control. If you submit a contact form or otherwise indicate your interest
        in contacting a Third-Party Provider, you may receive telemarketing calls from the
        Third-Party Provider using the contact information you provided. Third-Party Providers may
        keep your contact information and any other information received by the Third-Party Provider
        in processing a contact or other request form. We are not responsible for any damages or
        costs of any type arising out of or in any way connected with your dealings with these
        third parties.</li>
      <li><span class="highlight">B. Certain Third-Party Services.</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="underline">(i) Referrals and Lead Sales.</span> As part of the Services,
            you may be connected with a real estate professional. You authorize us to make such
            referral or lead sale and acknowledge that we may be paid valuable consideration for
            facilitating such connection. As part of the Services, you may be connected to a party
            that provides mortgage loan origination services, title and escrow services, or other
            settlement services. . In the event that any of these parties have an affiliated
            relationship with any of the Hunt Companies, then one or more of the Hunt Companies may
            receive a financial or other benefit from the referral between such affiliates</li>
          <li><span class="underline">(ii) Non-Affiliated Financial Products.</span> If you choose
            to contact a non-affiliated bank, mortgage lender, financial institution, mortgage loan
            originator, loan broker, or other mortgage professional through the Services by filling
            out a contact, other request form or otherwise indicating your interest in contacting
            (or being contacted by) a Third-Party Provider (including requests for mortgage rate
            quotes) on the Services, you authorize the Hunt Companies to provide the information
            you submit to the Third-Party Provider. If you include your name, contact information
            and other information in a request, your identity will no longer be anonymous to the
            Third-Party Provider. Your submission of information and any request for quotes through
            the Services is not an application for credit. In the case of non-affiliated financial
            products, the Hunt Companies are only providing an administrative service to consumers
            and participating Third-Party Providers. Loan approval standards are established and
            maintained solely by individual Third-Party Providers. Decisions in any related
            non-affiliated transactions are made by participating Third-Party Providers and are not
            made by the Hunt Companies and the Hunt Companies are not responsible for the
            underwriting activities or credit decisions of any Third-Party Provider. Interest rates
            displayed through the Services are for informational purposes only and reflect
            non-binding quotes of the terms a Third-Party Provider might offer an applicant fitting
            a consumer’s anonymous profile. Actual interest rates may vary. Consumers should rely
            on their own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms, and Third-Party
